# Atari STE GST MCU + GST Shifter
Simulation model of the Atari STE GSTMCU + Shifter

This repository contains a Verilog model of the Atari STE GST MCU (Glue + MMU combo).
The model tries to be an exact replica based on the [schematics recovered](https://www.chzsoft.de/asic-web/) by Christian Zietz.
The code contains both the identical gate-level circuits with asynchronous clocking, and a synchronous model hopefully suitable for FPGA synthesis.

There's a Shifter implementation, too, with both Video and Sound shifting. The core of the video shifter is based on the [reverse engineering](http://www.atari-forum.com/viewtopic.php?t=29658) work by Jorge Cwik.

# Testbench

The tb/ directory contains a testbench, which runs the circuits to generate waveforms for several frames. Also an rgb file is created using a RAM dump.
It requires Verilator for running the tests and generate the .vcd file, and ffmpeg to convert the .rgb output to .png.
To run the test:

```
cd tb
gzip -d stram.bin.gz
make
```

To see the genarated waveforms:

```
gtkwave gstmcu.vcd
```

To see a generated video frame:

```
make video
```

With the included RAM dump, the generated screen should look like:
